Additional Resources
=====================

Minecraft mod to add loose resources to the game without needing the user to install a texture pack. It is mainly
designed for mods that have user-defined content that needs to be loaded as a resource.

It has no GUI itself.

This mod requires FML.

Builds for 1.7: ![](http://jamesmckay.id.au:8080/job/AdditionalResources/badge/icon)

Usage
-----

The mod will create a directory (or you can create it yourself) next to the mods directory called
"mods-resourcepacks".

Inside that folder, put what would be in the assets folder, except for "pack.mcmeta".
e.g. "assets/mymod/lang/en_US.lang" => "mods-resourcepacks/mymod/lang/en_US.lang"
